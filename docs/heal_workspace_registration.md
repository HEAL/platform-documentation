## Guidelines for Requesting Extended Access to HEAL Data Platform Workspaces using STRIDES

> Please Note: The process for granting access for a workspace account through NIH STRIDES can take up to two weeks.

The workspace account is handled with the help of **NIH STRIDES** (NIH **S**cience and **T**echnology **R**esearch **I**nfrastructure for **D**iscovery, **E**xperimentation, and **S**ustainability). The NIH STRIDES Initiative allows NIH to explore the use of cloud environments to streamline NIH data use by partnering with commercial providers.

By leveraging the STRIDES Initiative, NIH and NIH-funded institutions can begin to create a robust, interconnected ecosystem that breaks down silos related to generating, analyzing, and sharing research data.

NIH-funded researchers with an active NIH award may take advantage of the STRIDES Initiative for their NIH-funded research projects. Eligible researchers include NIH intramural researchers and awardees of NIH contracts, other transaction agreements, grants, cooperative agreements, and other agreements. More information on NIH STRIDES and how to gain access can be found [here](https://datascience.nih.gov/strides). Please see below for registration steps

1. Users will receive an invitation via email to register for an NIH STRIDES workspace account. Users can click the link in the invitation email or request a workspace account by visiting [https://healportal.org/](https://healportal.org/) and logging in.

      *For information on the NIH STRIDES options, please refer to the [official page](https://datascience.nih.gov/strides)*.

    * The **STRIDES Grant/Award Funded** form can be selected if researchers have received NIH funding (e.g. a grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or other transaction agreement) and intend to use these funds for a HEAL Data Platform Workspace account. With this option, the researchers' organization will be responsible for payment.

        ![](../img/strides_grant_form.png)

    *  Select the **STRIDES Credits** form to request credits from the NIH STRIDES Initiative for the HEAL Data Platform Workspace account. With this option, once the request is approved, a new account with a spending limit of $XXX will be provisioned for usage.

4. Submit the request. Note that the process of granting access for a workspace account can take up to two weeks and users will be notified. Following the approval, users will see the current workspace accounts and credits on the landing page.
