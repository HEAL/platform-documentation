Below the `Study` field is a checklist of core CDEs. Check the box for any you wish to associate with your study. As you select CDEs, they will populate in the box at the bottom of the section.

> If you or someone else on your team has already submitted CDEs, you will see these checked and listed in the box. You can update the CDE list by adding or removing CDEs and resubmitting the form.

To add Supplemental CDEs not in the core list, you can click in the box beneath the core list and begin typing CDE names or codes to filter other CDEs that include the typed string (see the yellow highlighting). Click the CDE in the filtered list to add.
