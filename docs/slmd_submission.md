## Fill out your CEDAR form  

The act of submitting the study registration form will result in the creation of a metadata input
form within your CEDAR account:

- Find the form for your study under the 'Shared with Me' folder on CEDAR
  (accessible in the left-hand navigation).
- When you enter additional data into the CEDAR form, be sure to SAVE your
  changes by scrolling to the bottom of the form.
- The HEAL Data Platform will pull entries from the CEDAR templates into the
  Platform to enhance search capabilities and provide increasingly robust
  study details.

Watch our tutorial videos to learn how to interact with the CEDAR metadata forms and submit study-level metadata.
