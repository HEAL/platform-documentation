# Submitting a Data Dictionary

Data Dictionaries, which contain variable-level metadata, describe each variable within a dataset. Examples of variable-level attributes include the variable name, description (or variable label), type, format, terminology, source, and derivation.

!!! info

    Data dictionaries must conform to the HEAL variable level metadata schema. 
    
    Submissions should not include data of any kind. Submissions containing data will be removed from the Platform.
