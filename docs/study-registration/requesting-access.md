## Step 2: Find your study

From the [Discovery Page](https://healdata.org/portal/discovery), find the study you
wish to request access to register. *(If you cannot find your study, contact us at heal-support@datacommons.io.)*

- Click on the study to open the Study Page
- At the top of the Study Page, select `Request Access to Register This Study`
  to navigate to the Study Registration Access Request form.

> In cases where a study is represented by multiple records on the HEAL Data Platform but data and/or other digital artifacts will only be shared collectively (e.g., through a DCC or in the case of a study that has records from multiple years of funding and/or supplements but will be sharing data only through the parent award), it's likely not necessary that each grant be represented and registered as a stand-alone record on the Platform. If you would like to discuss the representation of your awards on the HEAL Data Platform, please contact us at [heal-support@datacommons.io](mailto:heal-support@datacommons.io).


## Step 3: Complete the Study Registration Access Request Form

- The field `Study Name - Grant Number` will already be filled in.
- You will need to provide your name, your email address, institutional
  affiliation and role on the project/study.
