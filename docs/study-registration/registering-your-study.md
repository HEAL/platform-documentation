## Step 2: Find your study

From the [Discovery Page](https://healdata.org/portal/discovery), find the
study you wish to register:

- Click on the study to open the Study Page 
- At the top of the Study Page, select ‘Request Access to Register This Study’
  to navigate to the [Study Registration form](https://healdata.org/portal/study-reg).

## Step 3:  Complete the Study Registration form

- The `Study` field will already be filled in
- If known, a valid ClinicalTrials.gov ID (NCT #) can be entered, which will
  enable the platform to pull some additional metadata related to the study.
- If known, select the repository you have submitted data to, or intend to
  submit data to.  This will help the Platform us and the repository to which
  you have submitted or will be submitting your data to anticipate and plan
  accordingly.
  - If your repository is not listed, please
    [contact us](mailto:heal-support@datacommons.io) with those details.
- Enter the unique ID for your study within the repository.
- Submit your registration.
- After you successfully register your study, the study will disappear from the HEAL Data Platform for about 24 hours while we sync the study record with the new CEDAR form. You do not need to do anything for it to reappear. 

Alternate steps to register a study:

- Login to the [Study Registration form](https://healdata.org/portal/study-reg)
- Choose the study you wish to register from the Study dropdown.  Only those
  studies you have been approved to register will be displayed in the dropdown.
- Complete the form as noted above and submit.

## Next Steps: Fill out your CEDAR form  

The act of submitting the study registration form will result in the creation of a metadata input
form within your CEDAR account:

- Find the form for your study under the 'Shared with Me' folder on CEDAR
  (accessible in the left-hand navigation).
- When you enter additional data into the CEDAR form, be sure to SAVE your
  changes by scrolling to the bottom of the form.
- The HEAL Data Platform will pull entries from the CEDAR templates into the
  Platform to enhance search capabilities and provide increasingly robust
  study details.
- An overview of completing the CEDAR metadata form can be found [here](../slmd_submission.md).
